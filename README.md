# RVF Classifier – Text Classification Pipeline

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **text classification system** for detecting and categorising text entries (e.g., fake news detection).  
It covers the full pipeline from **data loading → preprocessing → exploratory analysis → model training → evaluation → ensemble methods**.

## Features
- Automatic installation of required Python packages.
- Dataset loading and preview.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualisations.
- Text preprocessing:
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - Lemmatization
  - Sentiment analysis with TextBlob
- Feature extraction using:
  - TF-IDF Vectorizer
  - Count Vectorizer
- Model training with:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Ensemble classification using a Voting Classifier.
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
- Word cloud generation for text visualisation.
